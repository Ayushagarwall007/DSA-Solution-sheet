// Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge u v, vertex u comes before v in the ordering.

// Note: Topological Sorting for a graph is not possible if the graph is not a DAG.


// We start from a vertex, we first print it, and then 
// Recursively call DFS for its adjacent vertices. 
// In topological sorting,

// We use a temporary stack. 
// We donâ€™t print the vertex immediately, 
// we first recursively call topological sorting for all its adjacent vertices, then push it to a stack. 
// Finally, print the contents of the stack. 
// Note: A vertex is pushed to stack only when all of its adjacent vertices (and their adjacent vertices and so on) are already in the stack

// Approach:

// Create a stack to store the nodes.
// Initialize visited array of size N to keep the record of visited nodes.
// Run a loop from 0 till N
// if the node is not marked True in visited array
// Call the recursive function for topological sort and perform the following steps.
// Mark the current node as True in the visited array.
// Run a loop on all the nodes which has a directed edge to the current node
// if the node is not marked True in the visited array:
// Recursively call the topological sort function on the node
// Push the current node in the stack.
// Print all the elements in the stack.
